# GIMP-theme
A theme I hacked together for GIMP 2.10/xx to meet my needs. You might like it. You might not. Give it a shot.

Personally, I find it much better than the default themes/layout that comes with GIMP.

This is a tweaked version of the Orange Hints Theme by migf1 over at;

The layout for GIMP that I use is found in the sessionrc file.

There's a couple readme.txt files in the tarball that should get you up and running.

Given how wonky FOSS can be, it might not work for you for whatever reason, but it will make a  great starting point if you want GIMP to look 100x better.

Enjoy!
